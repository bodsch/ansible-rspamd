  ## debug_modules           A list of modules that are enabled for debugging.
  ## log_usec                Log microseconds (e.g. 11:43:16.68071). Default: false.

rspamd_workers:
  ## normal: this worker is designed to scan mail messages
  normal:
    options:
      ## bind_socket - a string that defines bind address of a worker. If the port number is omitted, port 11333 is assumed.
      ## count - number of worker instances to run (some workers ignore that option, e.g. hs_helper)
      ## enabled (1.6.2+) - a Boolean (true or false), enable or disable a worker (true by default)
      bind_socket: localhost:11333
      ## mime: turn to false if you want to scan non-mime messages (e.g. forum comments or SMS), default: true
      ## allow_learn: turn to true if you want to learn messages using this worker (usually you should use controller worker), default: false
      ## timeout: input/output timeout, default: 1min
      ## task_timeout: maximum time to process a single task, default: 8s
      ## max_tasks: maximum count of tasks processes simultaneously, default: 0 - no limit
      ## keypair: encryption keypair

  ## rspamd_proxy: handles requests forwarding and milter protocol
  rspamd_proxy:
    options:
      ## bind_socket - a string that defines bind address of a worker. If the port number is omitted, port 11333 is assumed.
      ## count - number of worker instances to run (some workers ignore that option, e.g. hs_helper)
      ## enabled (1.6.2+) - a Boolean (true or false), enable or disable a worker (true by default)
      bind_socket: localhost:11332

  ## controller: this worker performs configuration actions, such as learning, adding fuzzy hashes and serving web interface requests
  controller:
    options:
      ## bind_socket - a string that defines bind address of a worker. If the port number is omitted, port 11333 is assumed.
      ## count - number of worker instances to run (some workers ignore that option, e.g. hs_helper)
      ## enabled (1.6.2+) - a Boolean (true or false), enable or disable a worker (true by default)
      bind_socket: localhost:11334
      ## password: password for read-only commands
      ## enable_password: password for write commands
      ## secure_ip: list or map with IP addresses that are treated as secure so all commands are allowed from these IPs without passwords (if a reverse proxy sets an X-Forwarded-For header, both the proxy and actual client IP must be contained in secure_ip)
      ## static_dir: directory where interface static files are placed (usually ${WWWDIR})
      ## stats_path: path where controller save persistent stats about rspamd (such as scanned messages count)
      ## bind_socket : a string that defines bind address of a worker-controller (web interface). If the port number is omitted, port 11334 is assumed (see also the common workers options)

  ## fuzzy_storage: stores fuzzy hashes
  fuzzy:
    options:
      ## bind_socket - a string that defines bind address of a worker. If the port number is omitted, port 11333 is assumed.
      ## count - number of worker instances to run (some workers ignore that option, e.g. hs_helper)
      ## enabled (1.6.2+) - a Boolean (true or false), enable or disable a worker (true by default)
      bind_socket: localhost:11335
      count: -1
      ## hashfile - path to the sqlite storage (where are also few outdated aliases for this command exist: hash_file, file, database)
      ## backend - set it to redis if you want to use a redis server
      ## sync - time to perform database sync in seconds, default value: 60
      ## expire - time value for hashes expiration in seconds, default value: 2 days
      ## keypair - encryption keypair (can be repeated for different keys), can be obtained via rspamadm keypair -u command
      ## keypair_cache_size - Size of keypairs cache, default value: 512
      ## encrypted_only - allow encrypted requests only (and forbid all unknown keys or plaintext requests)
      ## master_timeout - master protocol IO timeout
      ## sync_keypair - encryption key for master/slave updates
      ## masters - string, allow master/slave updates from the following IP addresses
      ## master_key - allow master/slave updates merely using the specified key
      ## slave - list of slave hosts.
      ## mirror - list of slave hosts, same as slave
      ## allow_update - string, array of strings or a map of IP addresses that are allowed to perform changes to fuzzy storage (you should also set read_only = no in your fuzzy_check plugin
