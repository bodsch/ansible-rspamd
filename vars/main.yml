rspamd_defaults_workers:
  ## normal: this worker is designed to scan mail messages

      ## bind_socket - a string that defines bind address of a worker. If the port number is omitted, port 11333 is assumed.

      ## password: password for read-only commands
      ## enable_password: password for write commands
      ## secure_ip: list or map with IP addresses that are treated as secure so all commands are allowed from these IPs without passwords 
      ##            (if a reverse proxy sets an X-Forwarded-For header, both the proxy and actual client IP must be contained in secure_ip)
      ## static_dir: directory where interface static files are placed (usually ${WWWDIR})
      ## stats_path: path where controller save persistent stats about rspamd (such as scanned messages count)
      ## bind_socket : a string that defines bind address of a worker-controller (web interface).

      ## sync_keypair - encryption key for master/slave updates
      ## masters - string, allow master/slave updates from the following IP addresses

      ## allow_update - string, array of strings or a map of IP addresses that are allowed to perform changes to fuzzy storage
